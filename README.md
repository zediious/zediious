For a long time, I did not attempt to truly educate myself in Software Development, it felt like something that was simply out of my reach. I have been diving deep into learning, and one thing I can tell anyone who is on the fence is that you absolutely CAN DO THIS!

I still have a long way until I have reached a level I want, but you do have to start to get somewhere!

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Full stack web application development, automation tools for server management, Skyrim and Minecraft mods
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to create Skyrim SKSE plugin-based mods in C++ off of CommonLibSSE-NG
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything at all! If you think I could provide something to your project, definitely let me know 😉
