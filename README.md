## Hello! I am Zediious

### I run ShadowRaptor, a Modded Minecraft server network. Check us out at [our website](https://www.shadowraptornetwork.com/)!

<hr>

For a long time, I did not attempt to really educate myself in Software Development. This was because it felt like something that was simply "out of my league".

Over the past few months, I have been diving deep into learning these things. One of thing I can tell anyone else who is also on the fence, you absolutely CAN DO THIS!

I still have a long way until I have reached a level I want, but you do have to start to get somewhere!
