For a long time, I did not attempt to really educate myself in Software Development, it felt like something that was simply out of my reach.

Over the past few months, I have been diving deep into learning these things. One of thing I can tell anyone else who is also on the fence, you absolutely CAN DO THIS!

I still have a long way until I have reached a level I want, but you do have to start to get somewhere!

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Full-Stack web development | Minecraft Mods | Server-Side apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Back-End web stack | Node.js | Java/Spring | Python/Django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Nothing in particular, anything at all.
