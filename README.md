For a long time, I did not attempt to truly educate myself in Software Development, it felt like something that was simply out of my reach. I have been diving deep into learning, and one thing I can tell anyone who is on the fence is that you absolutely CAN DO THIS!

I still have a long way until I have reached a level I want, but you do have to start to get somewhere!

- 👀 I’m interested in ... 75% stack web development, automation tools/apps, Minecraft mods
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Back-End web stack, Python/Django, custom authentication backends, Minecraft mods
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything at all! If you think I could provide something to your project, definitely let me know 😉
